# Flare-Free Vision: Empowering Uformer with Depth Insights
Image flare is a common problem that occurs when a camera lens is pointed at a strong light source. It can manifest as ghosting, blooming, or other artifacts that can degrade the image quality. We propose a novel deep learning approach for flare removal that uses a combination of depth estimation and image restoration. We use a Dense Vision Transformer to estimate the depth of the scene. This depth map is then concatenated to the input image, which is then fed into a Uformer, a general U-shaped transformer for image restoration. Our proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Flare7K++ test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in removing flare artifacts from images. Our approach also demonstrates robustness and generalization to real-world images with various types of flare. We believe that our work opens up new possibilities for using depth information for image restoration.

unzip dataset.zip -d dataset
```

## Training

### Training Using Single GPU
To start training, you need to configure your training parameters in `options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml`. Then, run the following command:

```python
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```

**Note:** you can start autmotaically from a checkpoint by adding `--auto_resume` to the command above.
```python
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml --auto_resume
```

### Training Using Multiple GPUs
To start training using multiple GPUs, you need to configure your training parameters in `options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml`. Then, run the following command:

```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash scripts/dist_train.sh 2 options/uformer_flare7kpp_baseline_option.yml
```

## Testing

### Saved Checkpoint
We have uploaded our trained model on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQ2ZG3HHoBOogYw_qnH3SgLlNlsQtPST/view?usp=sharing). To use it, you can download it and put it in `experiments/flare7kpp/pretrained.pth`.

### Inference
To start inference on test dataset, you can run the following command:

```python
python basicsr/inference.py --input dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/input/ --output result/real/pretrained/ --model_path experiments/flare7kpp/pretrained.pth --flare7kpp
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the model using PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, Glare PSNR, and Streak PSNR, you can run the following command:

```python
python evaluate.py --input result/real/pretrained/blend/ --gt dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/gt/ --mask dataset/Flare7Kpp/test_data/real/mask/
```
